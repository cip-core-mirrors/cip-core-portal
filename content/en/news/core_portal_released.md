#### What is it?

Today we're opening the source code of the web portal used to help users to find relevant information about products and services available on the {{< link href="#" blank="true">}}Cloud Innovation Platform{{< /link >}}.



#### Why we opened it?

Because we believe that sharing it:
- may help us accelerate with external contributors
- may prevent others from reinventing what we already did to address their challenges
- will help us in communicating about our technical stacks implementations with vendors
- will allow vendors to integrate their solutions with our platform



#### Why is it called core website portal?

Our Cloud Innovation Platform provides resources both on-premise and off-site using external cloud service providers.
It make no sense to share with a public community information relevant to our on-premise solutions.
So we chose to concentrate all non-corporate specific content in this "*core portal*" out of which a "*corporate portal*" is built to cover our global scope.
