## Who are we?

## Why are we building this platform?

There are already many valuable services available on Internet so why create a
new platform? Because we couldn't find the perfect fit for our needs! Read on!


-   **Portability**

    We have an hybrid cloud strategy. We build our own internal cloud services
    and leverage major public cloud service providers. Workloads can be 
    deployed on the internal, the external or across both environments 
    depending on our business needs.

    We also want to avoid as possible to be vendor-locked. Deploying our Cloud
    Innovation Platform both internaly and on selected cloud service providers
    allow us to offer to our Service & Business Units the choice to leverage
    a broader range of services and solutions for their apps.



-   **Security**

    No doubt that cloud services available are or can be configured to suit 
    most security needs. But we wanted to build from ground-up a platform that
    could be designed, implemented and operated in a **DevSecOps / NoOps**
    approach. And we wanted to have more control on which options are available
    to our Cloud Innovation Platform users. 
    


-   **Traceability & auditability**

    All incoming and outgoing network traffic must be logged, analyzed on the
    fly and stored for post-processing. Cloud Service Providers have solutions
    to do this but it requires a lot of technical background. Our Cloud
    Innovation Platform was built technical and non-technical users.
